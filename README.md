# PRAYER ROOM
'''
 The prayer room is an application desingened for everyone to pray. Find time to pray everyday. May we please the messiah, his father, and the holy spirit through prayer, fasting, and repetance.
 
 Let us set aside time to pray for god's grace and blessing. The image of god and blessing. The image of god and will thoughts of god will be strengthened in the individuls and families who pray. The forces of darkness will depart.

If families are to grow in the experience of god everyday, all members of the families must pray together. No weapon can be strengthened against prayer.
